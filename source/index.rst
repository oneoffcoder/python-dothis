==========================

Preface
=======

This book shows how to write beautiful, idiomatic Python code with simple, effective examples. There are no long explanations, but the intention is to **show** and **demonstrate** preferred ways of writing code in Python. As such, the intended audience is for intermediate Python programmers looking to improve ways to write and express their code in a readable way while still preserving computational efficiency and effectiveness.
