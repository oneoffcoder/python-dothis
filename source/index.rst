Python: Do This, Not That!
==========================

Preface
=======

This book shows how to write beautiful, idiomatic Python code with simple, effective examples. There are no long explanations, but the intention is to **show** and **demonstrate** preferred ways of writing code in Python. As such, the intended audience is for intermediate Python programmers looking to improve ways to write and express their code in a readable way while still preserving computational efficiency and effectiveness. 

Under each major section, you will see two sub-sections: `Don't Do This` and `Do This`. Code under `Don't Do This` are discouraged, and following the adjective of |JeffKnupp_Link| :cite:`JeKn19`, are harmful. Code under `Do This` are the encouraged, beautiful and idiomatic Pythonic way to write the code instead.

Ideas and code examples are borrowed from :cite:`RaHe19b,JeKn19,YaKh19`.
